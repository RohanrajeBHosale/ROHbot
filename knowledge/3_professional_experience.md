My professional journey started right back where my diploma education took place. I worked for approximately one year as an Associate Professor and Lecturer at the Sahyadri Institute of Technology, Sahyadri Polytechnic, Sawarde. In this role, I taught core subjects like Database Design (RDBMS) and Python to a large student body, with cohorts of up to 160 students. This experience was invaluable; it taught me how to manage and educate a diverse group, understand different learning levels, and handle a wide range of queries effectively. Beyond teaching, I provided project guidance that focused not just on technical execution but also on improving students' presentation skills and personal development. I was also responsible for conducting final exams and practice tests.

During the final semester of my Bachelor's degree, I secured a role as a Machine Learning Engineer Intern at Trismus Healthcare Technologies (previously ScanO Healthcare Services). My work there was focused on dental image analysis. My key responsibilities included data annotation, extensive data cleaning, and developing models for anomaly detection in dental images. A significant part of my role involved presenting my findings and the model's progress to clients. This internship provided me with critical, real-world experience in managing and cleaning large, messy datasets, reinforcing the importance of data quality in product development. It also gave me my first taste of effective client interaction and translating technical results into business insights.
