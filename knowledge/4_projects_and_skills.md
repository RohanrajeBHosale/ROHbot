### Key Projects

**Interactive Resume with Conversational AI Assistant (ROHbot):** This very project is a demonstration of my skills. I engineered this voice-enabled conversational AI assistant for my personal portfolio. It initially used the Web Speech API and a JavaScript-based NLU engine. I have since upgraded it to a full-stack RAG system with a Gemini-powered LLM, my own cloned voice via ElevenLabs, and a robust backend on Vercel.

**Agentic AI for Customer Support:** I built a production-ready conversational AI system using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and foundation models like GPT-4. The system was designed to automate 85% of Tier-1 customer queries. I engineered custom routing logic and fine-tuned prompts to ground the model's outputs, which successfully cut resolution time and reduced human escalation rates by 40%. A key feature was a continuous learning data pipeline to capture user feedback for automated retraining.

**Agentic AI-Driven Market Intelligence:** I designed a scalable agent framework using LangGraph and LangChain, leveraging Apache Spark and cloud services to process and analyze over 10,000 documents daily from more than 200 real-time data sources. This system employed RAG pipelines to ground LLM outputs (GPT-4, Claude 3) with real-time external data, achieving 92% accuracy in forecasting market shifts 3-5 weeks in advance. The insights were delivered through an interactive dashboard connected to a 15TB+ Google BigQuery warehouse.

**ML Framework for Skin Disease Detection:** I developed a complete end-to-end ML pipeline in R for early skin cancer detection. This project demonstrated my proficiency across the entire model lifecycle, from preprocessing to performance evaluation. The framework was modularized using the `caret` and `mlr` packages to enable plug-and-play integration of new classifiers, which improved diagnostic precision by 22%.
