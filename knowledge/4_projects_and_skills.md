### Key Projects

**1. Interactive Resume with Conversational AI Assistant (ROHbot):**
This project is a demonstration of my skills. I engineered this voice-enabled conversational AI assistant for my personal portfolio. It initially used the Web Speech API and a JavaScript-based NLU engine. I have since upgraded it to a full-stack RAG system with a Gemini/OpenAI-powered LLM, my own cloned voice via ElevenLabs, and a robust backend on Vercel.
- **Technologies:** Gemini/OpenAI, Supabase Vector, Node.js, Vercel, ElevenLabs
- **Signals:** Grounding + citations, Deployable, System design
- **Metrics:** Deployed system: ingest → index → retrieve → respond
- **Live Demo:** [https://www.rohanraje.com/](https://www.rohanraje.com/)
- **GitHub:** [https://github.com/RohanrajeBHosale/rohbot](https://github.com/RohanrajeBHosale/rohbot)

**2. Agentic AI for Customer Support:**
I built a production-ready conversational AI system using Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) and foundation models like GPT-4. The system was designed to automate 85% of Tier-1 customer queries. I engineered custom routing logic and fine-tuned prompts to ground the model's outputs, which successfully cut resolution time and reduced human escalation rates by 40%. A key feature was a continuous learning data pipeline to capture user feedback for automated retraining.

**3. Agentic AI-Driven Market Intelligence:**
I designed a scalable agent framework using LangGraph and LangChain, leveraging Apache Spark and cloud services to process and analyze over 10,000 documents daily from more than 200 real-time data sources. This system employed RAG pipelines to ground LLM outputs (GPT-4, Claude 3) with real-time external data, achieving 92% accuracy in forecasting market shifts 3-5 weeks in advance. The insights were delivered through an interactive dashboard connected to a 15TB+ Google BigQuery warehouse.

**4. AI Used Car Price Estimator:**
Production-grade XGBoost regressor deployed via Streamlit to predict vehicle market values with 82% accuracy.
- **Technologies:** XGBoost, Streamlit, Python, Scikit-Learn
- **Signals:** End-to-End ML, Deployment, Business Value
- **Metrics:** R² Score: 0.82, Trained on 300k+ real listings
- **GitHub:** [https://github.com/RohanrajeBHosale/ai-used-car-price-estimator](https://github.com/RohanrajeBHosale/ai-used-car-price-estimator)

**5. Sketch Studio — Sketch → Photorealistic Portraits:**
Stable Diffusion + ControlNet pipeline to preserve sketch structure while generating photorealistic portraits.
- **Technologies:** Stable Diffusion, ControlNet, BLIP, PyTorch
- **Signals:** Conditioned generation, Prompt adherence, Evaluation-ready
- **Metrics:** Qualitative evaluation grid for SSIM/CLIP adherence.
- **GitHub:** [https://github.com/RohanrajeBHosale/sketch-studio](https://github.com/RohanrajeBHosale/sketch-studio)

**6. Automated Data Quality Control Panel:**
ETL validation pipeline detecting schema violations and statistical outliers in financial data.
- **Technologies:** Python, SQL, Streamlit, Pandas
- **Signals:** Data Integrity, Automated Testing, Visualization
- **Metrics:** Reduced manual review by ~40% (simulated)
- **GitHub:** [https://github.com/RohanrajeBHosale/Automated-Data-Quality-Control-Panel](https://github.com/RohanrajeBHosale/Automated-Data-Quality-Control-Panel)

**7. Fake News Detection Engine (NLP):**
Fine-tuned transformer model with a simple inference layer and evaluation workflow.
- **Technologies:** RoBERTa, Hugging Face, Python
- **Signals:** Fine-tuning, Eval, Serving
- **Metrics:** Add F1 + dataset size + baseline comparison (e.g., F1 Score: 0.88, Trained on 100k articles)
- **GitHub:** [https://github.com/RohanrajeBHosale/Fake-News-Detection-Engine-NLP](https://github.com/RohanrajeBHosale/Fake-News-Detection-Engine-NLP)

**8. Data Pipeline — ETL to Analytics Outputs:**
ETL pipeline design focusing on clean transforms, reliability, and query-ready outputs.
- **Technologies:** Python, SQL, Spark/BigQuery
- **Signals:** ETL, Scalable, Production mindset
- **Metrics:** Add runtime + schedule + data volume (e.g., Average runtime: 15 mins, Daily schedule, Processed 1TB daily)
- **GitHub:** [https://github.com/RohanrajeBHosale/Data-Pipeline-ETL-to-Analytics-Outputs](https://github.com/RohanrajeBHosale/Data-Pipeline-ETL-to-Analytics-Outputs)

**9. ML Framework for Skin Disease Detection:**
I developed a complete end-to-end ML pipeline in R for early skin cancer detection. This project demonstrated my proficiency across the entire model lifecycle, from preprocessing to performance evaluation. The framework was modularized using the `caret` and `mlr` packages to enable plug-and-play integration of new classifiers, which improved diagnostic precision by 22%.
