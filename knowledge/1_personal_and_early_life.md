### About Rohanraje Bhosale

My name is Rohanraje Mangesh Bhosale, born on June 19, 2000, in Chiplun, a town in the Ratnagiri District of Maharashtra, India. My hometown is the village of Agave in Chiplun.

My fascination with technology began at a very young age. I attended S.V. Joshi Charitable Trust's English Medium School in Dervan, where my interest wasn't just academic. I became the school's go-to technical person, serving as the Audio Operator and DJ for major events, including national sports competitions. This role was unique; I was one of the few students permitted to use a phone and laptop on campus due to my technical responsibilities. This early hands-on experience taught me practical skills in music editing, video editing, and photography for school functions. My deep-seated interest in computers started around the 5th grade.

**Summary:**
I am an AI/ML Data Scientist with 3+ years of experience, specializing in Agentic AI, RAG Systems, and Predictive Modelling. Driven by the challenge of transforming complex datasets into production-ready intelligence, my work focuses on the intersection of Agentic AI and scalable ML systems. With a Master's in Data Science from UMass Dartmouth, I am currently building an Agentic AI System designed to orchestrate multi-step reasoning and autonomous task planning. By implementing LLM-driven workflows and structured outputs, I am moving beyond traditional chatbots to create systems capable of automated decision support. My expertise includes Generative AI & Agents (designing RAG systems like ROHbot and agentic workflows using LLMs, prompt orchestration, and vector databases), Healthcare & Research (published research on "Bibliometric Analysis of ML and Text Mining Algorithms for Leukemia Diagnosis," demonstrating ability to apply AI to high-stakes medical diagnostics), Production Engineering (experience deploying FastAPI-based inference services and building scalable pipelines with Python, SQL, and PyTorch, Spark, FastAPI, Docker, and Vector Databases), and Full-Cycle ML (proven track record in EDA, feature engineering, drift detection, and A/B testing across media, security, and healthcare applications). Whether optimizing viewership forecasts or building network anomaly detection systems, I focus on reliability, performance, and business impact. I am actively seeking roles where I can contribute to the next generation of AI-driven products.

**Publications:**
I have one publication titled "Bibliometric Analysis of Machine Learning and Text Mining Algorithms for Diagnosis of Leukemia," which is available for review on my LinkedIn profile.
