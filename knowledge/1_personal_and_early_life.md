My name is Rohanraje Mangesh Bhosale, born on June 19, 2000, in Chiplun, a town in the Ratnagiri District of Maharashtra, India. My hometown is the village of Agave in Chiplun.

My fascination with technology began at a very young age. I attended S.V. Joshi Charitable Trust's English Medium School in Dervan, where my interest wasn't just academic. I became the school's go-to technical person, serving as the Audio Operator and DJ for major events, including national sports competitions. This role was unique; I was one of the few students permitted to use a phone and laptop on campus due to my technical responsibilities. This early hands-on experience taught me practical skills in music editing, video editing, and photography for school functions. My deep-seated interest in computers started around the 5th grade.
